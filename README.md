## Dice Roller
### [Code](https://github.com/jantes86/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Atomic%20Dice%20Roller.py)
### Lessons Learned
This was our first python assignment, so we learned about 'while' loops, the randint function, and the basic syntax of python. Our main issue was how to get the loop to stop, how to get the Pi to detect input, or, more accurately, how to use that input to impact the code. 
## Calculator
### [Code](https://github.com/jantes86/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/MrModulo.py)
### Lessons Learned
Following the rousing success of our first assignment we moved onto our calculator, which we so aptly name Mr. Modulo. The main lesson to be gained from this assignment is that the little stuff matters. We had been completely done with this for about thirty minutes, just trouble shooting nonstop, until we were told our issue was we needed a space between some numbers and some commas. And that fixed it. Gotta pay attention to that sweet, sweet syntax.
## Quadratic Solver
### [Code](https://github.com/jantes86/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Quadratic%20Solver%202.py)
### Lessons Learned
We made this assignment twice. The first time we did it, we made an adequate quadratic solver that solved all the equations, hurray we did it, hurrah. But as it turns out, we did it using the incorrect terminology. We hadn't used a formula. So we just defined one and told it to do it. The fix wasn't that complicated, but we did learn to read the canvas page more carefully, because that's a real time saver, not having to do an assignment over again. Also, ^ does not mean to the power. ** is powers. Who knew?
