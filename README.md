## Dice Roller
### [Code](https://github.com/jantes86/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Atomic%20Dice%20Roller.py)
### Lessons Learned
This was our first python assignment, so we learned about 'while' loops, the randint function, and the basic syntax of python. Our main isse was how to get the loop to stop, how to get the Pi to detect input, or, more accurately, how to use that input to impact the code.
